<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.OPTIONS">
<summary>
 Match on OPTIONS requests
 The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication
 options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI.
 This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated
 with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource
 action or initiating a resource retrieval.
 Responses to this method are not cacheable.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.TRACE">
 <summary><para>
 Match on TRACE requests.
 </para><para>
 The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of the
 request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message
 received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. The final
 recipient is either the origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a
 Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request (see section 14.31). A TRACE request
 MUST NOT include an entity.
 </para><para>
 TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other end of the request
 chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic information. The value of the Via
 header field (section 14.45) is of particular interest, since it acts as a trace of
 the request chain. Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the client to limit
 the length of the request chain, which is useful for testing a chain of proxies forwarding
 messages in an infinite loop.
 </para><para>
 If the request is valid, the response SHOULD contain the entire request message in
 the entity-body, with a Content-Type of "message/http". Responses to this method
 MUST NOT be cached.
 </para></summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.PATCH">
 <summary><para>
 Match on PATCH requests.
 </para><para>
 The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
 request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
 URI.  The set of changes is represented in a format called a "patch
 document" identified by a media type.  If the Request-URI does not
 point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource,
 depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify
 a null resource) and permissions, etc.
 </para><para>
 The difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is reflected in the
 way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource
 identified by the Request-URI.  In a PUT request, the enclosed entity
 is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the
 origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version
 be replaced.  With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set
 of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the
 origin server should be modified to produce a new version.  The PATCH
 method affects the resource identified by the Request-URI, and it
 also MAY have side effects on other resources; i.e., new resources
 may be created, or existing ones modified, by the application of a
 PATCH.

<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.HEAD">
 <summary><para>
 Match on HEAD requests.
 </para><para>
 The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body
 in the response. The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a
 HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request.
 This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the
 request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is often used for
 testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
 </para><para>
 The response to a HEAD request MAY be cacheable in the sense that the information
 contained in the response MAY be used to update a previously cached entity from that
 resource. If the new field values indicate that the cached entity differs from the
 current entity (as would be indicated by a change in Content-Length, Content-MD5,
 ETag or Last-Modified), then the cache MUST treat the cache entry as stale.
 </para></summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.PUT">
 <summary><para>
 Match on PUT requests
 </para><para>
 The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied
 Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the
 enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing
 on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource,
 and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user
 agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a new resource
 is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created)
 response. If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content)
 response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request. If
 the resource could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate
 error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem. The recipient
 of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does
 not understand or implement and MUST return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases.
 </para><para>
 If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more
 currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to
 this method are not cacheable.
 </para><para>
 The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the
 different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies the
 resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a data-accepting
 process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.
 In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the
 request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt
 to apply the request to some other resource. If the server desires that the request
 be applied to a different URI, it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response;
 the user agent MAY then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect
 the request.
 </para><para>
 A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For example, an article
 might have a URI for identifying "the current version" which is separate from the URI
 identifying each particular version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might
 result in several other URIs being defined by the origin server.
 </para><para>
 PUT requests MUST obey the message transmission requirements set out in section 8.2.
 </para><para>
 HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin server.
 </para><para>
 Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the entity-headers in the
 PUT request SHOULD be applied to the resource created or modified by the PUT.
 </para></summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.DELETE">
 <summary><para>
 Match on DELETE requests.
 </para><para>
 The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by
 the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means)
 on the origin server. The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been
 carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin server indicates that
 the action has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate
 success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete the resource
 or move it to an inaccessible location.
 </para><para>
 A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing
 the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content)
 if the action has been enacted but the response does not include an entity.
 </para><para>
 If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more
 currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this
 method are not cacheable.

<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.POST">
 <summary>
 <para>Match on POST requests.</para>
 <para>
 The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed
 in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in
 the Request-Line. POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following
 functions:
 </para>
 <list>
 <item>Annotation of existing resources;</item>
 <item>Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, similar group
 of articles;</item>
 <item>Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a
 data-handling process;</item>
 <item>Extending a database through an append operation.</item>
 </list>
 <para>
 The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server and is
 usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to that URI in
 the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article
 is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a
 database.
 </para><para>
 The action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be
 identified by a URI. In this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate
 response status, depending on whether or not the response includes an entity that
 describes the result.
 </para><para>
 If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be 201 (Created)
 and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the
 new resource, and a Location header (see section 14.30).
 </para><para>
 Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate
 Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However, the 303 (See Other) response can be
 used to direct the user agent to retrieve a cacheable resource.

<member name="P:Suave.Http.Applicatives.GET">
 <summary>
 Match on GET requests.
 <para>The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is
 identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process,
 it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and
 not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of
 the process.
 </para><para>
 The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the request
 message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match,
 or If-Range header field. A conditional GET method requests that the entity be
 transferred only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s).
 The conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by
 allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests
 or transferring data already held by the client.

 The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
 Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD
 continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.  This response
 is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header
 field.
 </para><para>
 The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
 response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
 response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
 the new URI(s).
 </para><para>
 If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other
 than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
 request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
 change the conditions under which the request was issued.

 </para></summary>
 <remarks>
    Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
    to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
    existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
    response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
    of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
    been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
    kind of reaction is expected of the client.
